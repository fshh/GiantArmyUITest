# Notes
 Only outside resource I used was [this easing function library](https://gist.github.com/cjddmut/d789b9eb78216998e95c). Normally I would use a full easing library like LeanTween or DOTween for this kind of work, but I wanted to implement the coroutine behaviors using the easing functions myself to demonstrate that I have an understanding of the concepts behing easing.
 The assignment asks for a panel with 5 properties, but when I implemented it my screen was too tall for expanding all 5 to activate the scrollbar. As a result, I added more properties to the panel.
 I had most of the panel implemented after 3 hours or so, minus an important consideration I was missing regarding the panel's margins. After that I spent some time going back and abstracting out slightly while I waited for question responses. Then I implemented the changes from the answers I got, added comments, and fixed the important case I had missed before. In total I spent about 6 hours on this assignment.
